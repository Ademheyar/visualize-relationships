# C File Relationship Analyzer

The C File Relationship Analyzer is a Python program that analyzes the relationships between .c and .h files in a directory and draws a visualization of the relationships using a GUI. The program can help you understand how the .c and .h files are related to each other and identify potential issues with your code structure.

## Getting Started

To use the C File Relationship Analyzer, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, you can download the C File Relationship Analyzer code from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/username/repo. You can download the code as a ZIP file or clone the repository using Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

After downloading the code, navigate to the directory containing the code in your terminal or command prompt:

```
cd path/to/c-file-relationship-analyzer
```

Next, install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the program:

```
python main.py
```

The program will open a GUI that allows you to select the main directory containing the .c and .h files. Once you select the directory, the program will analyze the relationships between the .c and .h files and draw a visualization of the relationships on the screen.

## Usage

To use the C File Relationship Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. Open the program by running `python main.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Click the "Select main directory" button to choose the directory containing the .c and .h files.

3. Once you select the directory, the program will analyze the relationships between the .c and .h files and draw a visualization of the relationships on the screen.

4. You can hover over the files and connections to see the names of the files and the relationships between them.

5. You can close the program by clicking the close button or pressing the "Escape" key.
